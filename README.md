# QA_Contours

This repository contains code and data to reproduce most figures in the paper: Predictive modeling using shape statistics for interpretable and robust quality assurance of automated contours in radiation treatment planning. Written by Zachary Wooten, Cenji Yu, Laurence Court, and Christine Peterson.

 - "MAIN_ShapeStatistics.R" This is the main file to run that will reproduce all figures from extracted shape data. 

- bad_kidney_hist_PSB.csv : The Histogram data of shape features from 52 unaccaptable kidney contours

- good_kidney_hist_PSB.csv : The Histogram data of shape features from 260 accaptable kidney contours

- bad_kidney_2D_PSB.csv : The shape features for every axial slice per patient from 52 unaccaptable kidney contours

- good_kidney_2D_PSB.csv : The shape features for every axial slice per patient from 260 accaptable kidney contours

- unlab_kidney_hist_PSB.csv : The Histogram data of shape features from 36 unlabeled kidney contours
